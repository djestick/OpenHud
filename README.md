A new **Overlay menu** has been added —  
you can now choose which monitor to display the overlay on and adjust its **position and size** directly from the UI.

</p>

Match creation has been **fully optimized**:
- Veto logic automatically adapts to **BO1**, **BO3**, or **BO5** formats  
- Picks, bans, and deciders are generated dynamically  
- You can easily alternate between teams in sequence with a single button —  
  and even switch which team starts the veto order

###  🕹️ Quick Actions

At the bottom of the menu, two important buttons have been added:

- **Switch Sides** — instantly swaps team sides  
- **Refresh HUD** — reloads your HUD without restarting the app  
- **Settings tab** — was removed
