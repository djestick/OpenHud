Match creation has been **fully optimized**:
- Veto logic automatically adapts to **BO1**, **BO3**, or **BO5** formats  
- Picks, bans, and deciders are generated dynamically  
- You can easily alternate between teams in sequence with a single button —  
  and even switch which team starts the veto order
