Now you can instantly switch between HUDs with a single click.  
The new **HUD Manager tab** allows quick access to all installed HUDs and applies them without restarting.

A new **Overlay menu** has been added —  
you can now choose which monitor to display the overlay on and adjust its **position and size** directly from the UI.

### ⚡ Match Creation Optimization

</p>

Match creation has been **fully optimized**:
- Veto logic automatically adapts to **BO1**, **BO3**, or **BO5** formats  
- Picks, bans, and deciders are generated dynamically  
- You can easily alternate between teams in sequence with a single button —  
  and even switch which team starts the veto order
